# VisimusicHelpers

This repo is designed to help out with assets for Visimusic, which can be found by clicking [here](https://marblelover003.github.io/Visimusic).

The new song tags can't be handled on there alone because they are too large in data size. The biggest file is *2.8 MB!*

For those who don't know, MB stands for megabyte, and is equal to a million bytes. That's a *lot* when you come to think about it.

This is where VisimusicHelpers comes in, so it can "help out" with making Visimusic better!
